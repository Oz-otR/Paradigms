This program is designed to solve the scheduling problem of pairing 8 systems to 8 tasks.

File has been successfully tested on the Linux machines in the computer science labs. You must compile all the files and then execute the project on command line with the following prompt:
	
	 swipl -o scheduler -g sched -c sched.pl

For example if you were to use minimalisticinput.txt and your output was output.txt:

	  ./scheduler input.txt output.txt

Remark: the myinput file must have the .txt extension.
